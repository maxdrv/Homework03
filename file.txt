This class provides a skeletal implementation of the link List
interface to minimize the effort required to implement this interface
backed by a random access data store such as an array  For sequential
access data such as a linked list link AbstractSequentialList should
be used in preference to this class
 
To implement an unmodifiable list the programmer needs only to extend
this class and provide implementations for the link get int and
 link Listsize size methods to
